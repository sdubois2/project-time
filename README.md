 Summary: The purpose of our project was to design a futureistic rougelike. While we didn't get there, we did get a good foundation for future development.

  Design: The design motto of our project was modularity. Almost everything we have can be reused in some shape or form. For example, after designing our main character,
  we used the player.gd file to construct a basis for enemy movement and gravity. Another good point of modularity would be our tile sets. Not only can we create specific 16x16
  bit tiles, but we can also use those same tiles on different TileMapLayer to serve different purposes. Need a specific computer destroyed later on? We can insert our base tiles
  for it, but have it interact with the player in a new unitque way.
